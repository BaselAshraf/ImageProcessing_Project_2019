# ImageProcessing_Project_2019

## Idea :
    The user takes a picture of a bus number then the application shows him the path of that bus
    

## Method used :
    We used OpenCV KNN charachter recognition to recognize the arabic numbers
    We took this link as a reference and modified a little to recognize arabic numbers
